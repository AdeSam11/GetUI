CHALLENGE
In Software Engineering, balancing aesthetics with functionality can be a challenge. Engineers often need to collaborate with designers to create visually appealing interfaces that align with the overall branding and purpose of the software. This project will not help developers/engineers to build better backend servers/database, but it is intended to help frontend developers and engineers to create amazing visuals. This project is not dependent on a specific locale
